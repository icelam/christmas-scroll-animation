# Christmas Animation using ScrollMagic, GSAP #

Christmas scroll animation demo using GSAP and Scroll Magic

## Note
This repository was created at late 2018, and the official recommended ways to create scroll-driven animations has changed.

According to the [GreenSock learning center](https://greensock.com/scrollmagic/):
> Note: This page was created before ScrollTrigger was released. We highly recommend using ScrollTrigger instead of ScrollMagic.

In [June 2020, GreenSock released ScrollTrigger](https://greensock.com/scrolltrigger-is-released/) to handle scroll-driven animations, if you are going to create any scroll-driven animations of your own, highly recommended that you should go and have a look at their [documentation](https://greensock.com/scrolltrigger)!
